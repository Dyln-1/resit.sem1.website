                <h2>Understanding CARP Design Principles</h2>
                <p>CARP stands for Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, and Proximity — four simple but powerful ideas used in design. These principles help organize content in a way that's both visually appealing and easy to read. Whether you're building a website, designing a poster, or working on a presentation, keeping CARP in mind can make a big difference.</p>

                <p>Contrast draws attention to important elements by making them stand out. Alignment keeps things neat and creates a clean, professional look. Repetition adds consistency across your design, while proximity groups related items together so they’re easier to understand. Using these techniques helps your work look more polished and communicates your message more clearly.</p>

    <div class="image-text-row">
 <img src="./images/proximity.png" alt="repitition poster" class="poster-image">
<p class="custom-font">
This is my Proximity Poster and this is very similer to my alignment poster but is positioned differently which gives it the name proximity. This proximity makes it easy for the viewer to understand the text.
